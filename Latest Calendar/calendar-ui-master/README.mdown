Introduction
====================

MACalendarUI is a project which offers calendar user interface for iPhone applications.

The _master_ branch uses ARC. If you do not use ARC, checkout the _non-arc_ branch.

The current version includes the following views:

MAWeekView
---------------------

A weekly view for viewing events, displays a whole week. Navigation using the arrows on
the top of the view or using the swipe gesture. It has two delegates: MAWeekViewDataSource and
MAWeekViewDelegate. To display events in the view, the MAWeekViewDataSource delegate
handles callback to a controller to get the event data. If you want to know when a particular
events is tapped on, implement the MAWeekViewDelegate protocol.

The internal view hierarchy for MAWeekView is the following:

    MAWeekView
      |
      |-- MAEventGridView           (all-day events)
      |     |
      |     |--- MAEventView        (events)
      |
      |
      |-- UIScrollView
            |
            |--- MAGridView
            |      |
            |      --- MAEventView   (events)
            |
            |--- MAHourView
            |
            |--- MAWeekdayView

For a quick start, please check the WeekViewExampleController which implements the both
MAWeekViewDataSource and MAWeekViewDelegate protocols. This example loads the view
from a NIB and if you plan to create the views without a NIB, you need to provide
a CGRect (initWithFrame) for MAWeekView.

MADayView
---------------------

MADayView is a daily view for displaying events. Please see the MADayViewDataSource and
MADayViewDelegate protocols for further details.
