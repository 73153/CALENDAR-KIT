genstrings -o MyCalendar/en.lproj/  MyCalendar/*.m


All localizable strings in code should be externalized and referenced using NSLocalizedString.
Create a Localizable.strings file, run from the project root, where "Classes/*.m" is where your classes files are:
genstrings -o English.lproj Classes/*.m
This will create a file in the root of your project.
Drag this from the Finder into your project, select "UFT-16" and "Do not copy".
Right click on the "Localizable.strings" and "Get Info".
Under the "General Tab" there should be "Localizations" with your default local language.
At the bottom of the window should be a "Add Localization" button, clicking this will allow you to add additional Localizations.
To append new keys rather then replace the whole file:
genstrings -o English.lproj *.m Classes/*.m
